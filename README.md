# Description

### This repository will contain assignments from the python study book. As the assignments are studied and solved, they will be added here. Not all assignments will be added here, but only the ones I think are necessary. Also in one assignment, several assignments can be combined, as a continuation of one of the assignments.

# Chapter two

[This](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_2) shows how to work with variables, simple data types, and
strings. Namely: `f-string`, case change (`lower()`, `upper()`, `title()`), hyphenation (`"\n"`), tabulation (`"\t"`)
and whitespace removal (`rstrip()`, `lstrip()`, `strip()`).

# Chapter three

[In this chapter](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_3) was working with lists. Namely, working with
list idexes, deleting, adding and modifying a list, sorting, list lengths.

# Chapter four

[In this chapter](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_4) we studied working with lists and tuples.
The for loop, for going through the list and outputting the list data. Also, creating a numeric list (`range()`),
slices(`list([::])`).
Tuples are like lists, they differ only in the fact that they cannot be changed and remain unchanged throughout the life
of the program. If you want to change a tuple, you must assign a new value to the variable where the tuple is stored.

# Chapter five

[In chapter five](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_5), we talk about the `if` statement. This
operator is used to check the current state of the program and choose further actions depending on the result of the
check. The center of this expression lays down the result, which is logical true `True` and logical false `False` -
checking the conditions. The equality operator `==`, inequality operator `!=`, and possible mathematical
comparisons `>, <, >=, <=` are also used to check conditions. Logical AND `and` and OR `or` are used to check several
conditions.
If you need to perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false, the `if-else` syntax is
used. Sometimes it is necessary to check several possible situations, for this purpose `if-elif-else` is used.

# Chapter six

[Chapter six](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_6) is about dictionaries - the key-value
`a = {"color": "red"}`. This data structure is designed to combine
related information. Sometimes it happens that you want to create an empty dictionary `a = {}`, and to add to the
dictionary you need to do the following:

```
a['color'] = 'red'
```

to delete you need to do the following:

```
del a['color']
```

You can also implement a list in the dictionary:

```
a = {
    'color': 'red'
    'alphabet': ['a', 'b', 'c'].
}
```

# Chapter seven

[Chapter 7](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_7) talks about the while loop and data entry.

Input `input()` is used to get input data and work with it in the program.

The `while` loop allows you to execute the program until a certain condition remains true.
