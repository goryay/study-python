# Description

### This repository will contain assignments from the python study book. As the assignments are studied and solved, they will be added here. Not all assignments will be added here, but only the ones I think are necessary. Also in one assignment, several assignments can be combined, as a continuation of one of the assignments.

# Chapter two
[This](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_2) shows how to work with variables, simple data types, and strings. Namely: `f-string`, case change (`lower()`, `upper()`, `title()`), hyphenation (`"\n"`), tabulation (`"\t"`) and whitespace removal (`rstrip()`, `lstrip()`, `strip()`).

# Chapter three
[In this](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_3) chapter was working with lists. Namely, working with list idexes, deleting, adding and modifying a list, sorting, list lengths.

# Chapter four
[In this](https://github.com/goryay/study-python/tree/main/chap_4) chapter we studied working with lists and tuples.
The for loop, for going through the list and outputting the list data. Also, creating a numeric list (`range()`), slices(`list([::])`).
Tuples are like lists, they differ only in the fact that they cannot be changed and remain unchanged throughout the life of the program. If you want to change a tuple, you must assign a new value to the variable where the tuple is stored.
